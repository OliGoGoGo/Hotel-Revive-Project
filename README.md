# Hotel-Revive-Project
For this project, we aim to analyze a comprehensive data set regarding hotels' reservations and cancellations. 
In the first part of the project, we will perform Exploratory Data Analysis and do a data cleaning regarding null and illogical data points. 
Then we will analyze specific areas within the data set to produce fruitful insight into the performance of hotels and customers. 
Finally, we will include a machine learning analysis to predict the cancellation of hotels. 
Specifically, we will using Logistic Model and Time Series Model in model fitting and then compare the prediction level between models to see which one has more precise prediction for our hotel dataset.
